          <Text>
            A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases
            (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our
            actions.
            <br />
            The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16
            tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average
            carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of
            avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon
            footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.
            <br />
            Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesnâ€™t
            happen overnight! By making small changes to our actions, like
            eating less meat, taking fewer connecting flights and line drying
            our clothes, we can start making a big difference.
